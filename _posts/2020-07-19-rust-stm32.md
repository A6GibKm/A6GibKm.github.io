title: Reading environmental data using embedded rust on STM32
tags: [rust, embedded]
---

There are valid concerns with embedded devices, specifically IoT devices,
ranging from the use of secure communication protocols, to memory safety issues.
This makes rust a natural choice of language to program embedded devices. 

Enter stm32, also know as *Blue Pill*. This is a very available and cheap (~2usd)
developer board, powered with a 72Mhz ARM 32-bit CPU, the "same" architecture that
powers most mobile devices. Rust currently provides Tier 2 support for ARM,
making this a perfect choice of board.

**Note**: There is also a newer model, called *Black Pill*, which
costs more or less the same and comes with better specifications and maintains
most of the layout.

## Setup

There are many embedded environmental sensors, in particular the sensors BME280,
BMP280, and BME680 by Bosch have rust crates. I will use a BME280 sensor in
this example with the following wiring.

| STM32 | BME280 |
| 3.3   | VCC    |
| G     | GND    |
| B6    | SCL    |
| B7    | SDA    |

In this example, I use a st-link v2 programmer for flashing and
debugging, configured as follows.

| STM32 | ST-Link V2 |
| +3.3V | 3.3V       |
| DIO   | SWDIO      |
| DCLK  | SWCLK      |
| GND   | GND        |

**Important**: Disconnect the blue-pill from any external source of power before
connecting the debugger to your machine.

## Rust and Cargo setup

Unless you are using an ARM machine, cross-compilation utilities have to be
installed via

```
sudo dnf install arm-none-eabi-binutils-cs
sudo apt-get install binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi
```

depending on the host distribution, and add the target architecture of the stm32
to the rust toolchain.

```
rustup target add thumbv7m-none-eabi 
```

We start the project `cargo init stm32_bme280` and add the following
dependencies to `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
bme280 = "0.2"
cortex-m-rt = "0.6"
cortex-m = "0.6"
stm32f1xx-hal = {version = "0.6", features = ["stm32f103", "rt"]}
panic-halt = "0.2"
rtt-target = { version = "0.2", features = ["cortex-m"] }
```

In order for the program to fit into memory we implement the following
compile-time optimizations

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = 's' # optimize for size ('z' would optimize even more)
lto = true # link with link time optimization (lto).
```

The `cortex-m-rt` crate requires a `memory.x` file at the project root specifying the memory layout
of the board, luckily, the [documentation][cortex-m-rt-docs] contains an example
for this specific board.

```
/* Linker script for the STM32F103C8T6 */
MEMORY
{
  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 64K
  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 20K
}
```

To make life more convenient we add the following to `.cargo/config`, to be able
to run `cargo build` without additional flags,

```toml
[build]
target = "thumbv7m-none-eabi"

rustflags = [
  "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x",
]
```

## Computing the altitude

It is a known-fact that the altitude can be computed as a function of the
pressure, a model for this is

$$
  h = h_0 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{p}{p_0}\right)^\alpha \right),
$$

were $$p_0$$ is the pressure at sea-level, $$p$$ the pressure, $$h \sim 44330\,m$$, and
$$\alpha \sim \frac{1}{5.255}$$. But there is a single problem, the
implementation of the power function `fmt::powf()` requires intrinsic CPU instructions which are not
available or implemented for this board. We can do the following approximation.

Let $$\varepsilon = 1- \frac{p}{p_0}$$. Then,
since the preassure at sea level is very similar to what can be measured at
home, $$\lvert \varepsilon \rvert \ll 1$$, and we can do the second order
approximation

$$
  h \sim h_0 \left( \alpha \varepsilon - \frac{1}{2} \alpha (\alpha - 1)
  \varepsilon^2 \right).
$$

## Program

The program used is the following.

```rust
#![deny(unsafe_code)]
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern crate panic_halt;

use stm32f1xx_hal::{
    prelude::*,
    pac,
    delay::Delay,
    i2c,
};

use cortex_m_rt::entry;
use bme280::BME280;
use rtt_target::{rtt_init_print, rprintln};

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    let cp = cortex_m::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
    let dp = pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
    let mut rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();

    // Set up the I2C bus
    let mut flash = dp.FLASH.constrain();
    let afio = dp.AFIO.constrain(&mut rcc.apb2);
    let mut gpiob = dp.GPIOB.split(&mut rcc.apb2);
    let scl = gpiob.pb6.into_alternate_open_drain(&mut gpiob.crl);
    let sda = gpiob.pb7.into_alternate_open_drain(&mut gpiob.crl);
    let mut mapr = afio.mapr;
    let mode = i2c::Mode::Standard { frequency: 40.hz() };
    let clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze(&mut flash.acr);
    let mut apb = rcc.apb1;
    let start_timeout_us: u32 = 10000;
    let start_retries: u8 = 5;
    let addr_timeout_us: u32 = 10000;
    let data_timeout_us: u32 = 10000;

    // Creates a blocking I2C1 object on pins PB6 and PB7
    let i2c = i2c::BlockingI2c::i2c1(
        dp.I2C1,
        (scl, sda),
        &mut mapr,
        mode,
        clocks,
        &mut apb,
        start_timeout_us,
        start_retries,
        addr_timeout_us,
        data_timeout_us,
        );

    // Set up the BME280
    let delay = Delay::new(cp.SYST, clocks);
    let mut bme280 = BME280::new_primary(i2c, delay);
    bme280.init().expect("BME280 initialization failed.");

    rtt_init_print!();
    rprintln!("BME280 ready.");

    let delay_time = 1_000_000; // millis
    let sea_level: f32 = 1013.25; // hPa
    let h: f32 =  44330.0 // m;
    let alpha: f32 = 1.0/5.225;

    loop {
        cortex_m::asm::delay(delay_time);

        let measurements = bme280.measure().unwrap();
        let pressure = measurements.pressure / 100.0; // measured in hPa
        // Second order Taylor serie for (1- epsilon)^alpha
        let epsilon = 1.0 - pressure / sea_level;
        let altitude = h * ( alpha * epsilon - 0.5 * alpha * (alpha - 1.0) * epsilon* epsilon );

        rprintln!("Temperature: {}°C", measurements.temperature);
        rprintln!("Altitude: {}m", altitude);
        rprintln!("Humidty: {}%", measurements.humidity);
        rprintln!("Pressure: {}hPa", pressure);
    }
}
```

Some important things to note. 

* We have to implement `#[panic_handler]`, the
crate [panic-halt][panic-halt], provides a lightweight implementation. 
* The [bme280][bme280] crate does not implement the required traits to use
  `i2c::i2c1`, so we use its blocking cousin `i2c::BlockingI2c::i2c1`, see [[2]][bme280-disc].
* `cargo-embed` uses the Real-Time transfer protocol, provided by `rtt-target`, instead of the more common
  semi-hosting method.
* The standard library is a no-go for most embedded applications, hence the use
  of `#![no_std]`.
  
## Flashing and testing

To run this program we are going to use `cargo-embed` from [probe-rs][probe.rs], which is a drop-in
replacement for `cargo run` for embedded devices, but it can do much more, such
as logging RTT output and opening a GDB server. It can be installed with,

```
cargo install cargo-embed
```

It is advisable to set add configuration file `Embed.toml`, with the following
contents, at the root of the project.

```toml
[default.general]
chip = "STM32F103C8" # Use --list-chips to see more.

[default.rtt]
enabled = true
```

The default values can be seen at the [default Embed.toml][default-embed]. Finally,
to run the program we simply run

```
cargo embed --release
```

and we can see the output of our program,

```
9:01:27.862  BME280 ready.
9:02:36.586  Temperature: 16.995693°C
19:02:36.586 Altitude: 596.0528m 
19:02:36.586 Humidty: 69.90904%
19:02:36.586 Pressure: 943.97943hPa
```

In my measurements, the approximation works just fine. I compared the
output with those from another BME280 sensor running on an Arduino board using
[Adafruit's BME280 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BME280_Library)
and saw a difference in the measurement of altitude of about 0.15%.

### Closing thoughts 

Rust provides a rapidly moving environment for embedded devices, with a friendly
community, and tools like
`cargo-embed` which make it a more streamlined process,
similar to the usual x86_64 experience. There are still a few rough edges, like the
board auto-detection not working in some cases but overall rust is becoming a
good language for IoT and embedded.
