title: Controlling your pi-hole with async python gpio
tags: [linux]
---

This project involves adding two buttons to your raspberry pi, one to disable
pihole for `n` seconds and the other to enable it back. I run many services on
one raspberry pi and a dummy synchronous `while True` loop will lock one core,
that isn't gonna fly.

## Setting

For this project we need three leds, two buttons, and one
330Î© resistance. We set the green, red and blue leds to pins 7, 15, and 12
respectively. In this project raspbian and a RPi 3B+ were used.

Check the pinout diagram of the raspberry pi at [pinout][pinout].

Let us start by listing the dependencies

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  # Import Raspberry Pi GPIO library
import pihole as ph
import atexit
import sys
import asyncio
```
## Controlling the pi-hole

We control the pihole with [PiHole-Api][pihole-api], for this we need the pihole
IP address and the WebUI password.

```python
pihole_addr = "192.168.0.21"
time_limit = 30 # Disable for at most 30 seconds
pihole_password = "PIHOLE_PASSWORD" # Set the password for first use

# Get password
password = pihole_password

# Pihole
pihole = ph.PiHole(pihole_addr)
pihole.authenticate(password)
version = pihole.getVersion()['core_current']
status = pihole.status
print("Runing pihole", version)
print("Status:", pihole.status)
```

## Using python-keyring to store passwords

Alternatively, using the [keyring][keyring] package we can securely store the
password.

```python
import keyring

from keyrings.alt.file import PlaintextKeyring

keyring.set_keyring(PlaintextKeyring())
password = keyring.get_password("pihole", pihole_addr)
if password is None:
    keyring.set_password("pihole", pihole_addr, pihole_password)
    password = pihole_password
```

On the first run set `pihole_password` to its real value and then set it to
`None`. The line `keyring.set_keyring(PlaintextKeyring())` should be only be
used if you do not want to be prompted for the keyring password every time, this
requires to add
```sh
[backend]
default-keyring=keyrings.alt.file.PlaintextKeyring
```
to `~/.local/share/python_keyring/crypted_pass.cfg`. See
[[3]][python-keyring-dont-ask].

## Setting the GPIOs

This project uses a blue led to signal that the pihole is disabled. First we
create a timer class to re-enable the pihole.

```python
## GPIO setup
red = 7  # Red using pin 7
green = 15  # Green using pin 15
blue = 12  # Blue using pin 12

## Async
loop = None
timer = None

# Timer
bouncetime = 500  # in ms

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, timeout, callback):
        self._timeout = timeout
        self._callback = callback
        self._task = asyncio.ensure_future(self._job())

    async def _job(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(self._timeout)
        await self._callback()

    def cancel(self):
        self._task.cancel()


async def timeout_callback():
    pihole.enable()
    GPIO.output(blue, GPIO.LOW)
```

We also add callbacks for the buttons 

```python
def button_pushed(pin):
    if loop is None:
        print("Loop ended")
        return  # should not come to this
    if pin == green:
        loop.call_soon_threadsafe(green_action)
    if pin == red:
        loop.call_soon_threadsafe(red_action)


def red_action():
    print("Red button was pushed!")
    GPIO.output(blue, GPIO.HIGH)
    pihole.disable(time_limit)
    timer = Timer(time_limit, timeout_callback)


def green_action():
    print("Green button was pushed!")
    if timer is not None:
        timer.cancel()
    GPIO.output(blue, GPIO.LOW)
    pihole.enable()
```

It is important to leave everything in a clean state when closing the program,
this is done using the `atexit` package.

```python
def exit_handler():
    print('py-hole-ui closed')
    GPIO.cleanup()
    pihole.enable()
    loop.close()
```

Now we can define the main loop

```python
try:
    GPIO.setwarnings(True)  # Set warnings
    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)  # Use physical pin numbering

    # Set pins to input/output
    GPIO.setup(red, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)
    GPIO.setup(green, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)
    GPIO.setup(blue, GPIO.OUT)

    GPIO.add_event_detect(
        green, GPIO.RISING, callback=button_pushed, bouncetime=bouncetime,
    )
    GPIO.add_event_detect(
        red, GPIO.RISING, callback=button_pushed, bouncetime=bouncetime,
    )

    atexit.register(exit_handler)
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_forever()

except:
    print("Error:", sys.exc_info()[0])
```

now python3 does not even appear in `top`, compared to the 100% usage one could
get using a more naive approach.
