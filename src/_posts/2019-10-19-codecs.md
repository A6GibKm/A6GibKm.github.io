title: Multimedia codecs in Fedora

Most codecs contain pieces of software which are not free or cannot be included
in Fedora repositories, adding rpm-fusion's repositories is required to for many
codecs to work, we show methods on how to get codecs working in Fedora.

## Enabling rpm-fusion repositories

- Fedora (22 and later):

```
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```

- Silverblue (29 and later):

```
sudo rpm-ostree install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```

See [rpmfusion.org/Configuration](https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration).

## Option A: Minimal setup

A minimal setup to run Firefox consists of

- Fedora: `sudo dnf install ffmpeg-libs`
- Silverblue: `sudo rpm-ostree install ffmpeg-libs`

This is enough to view YouTube and to browse Reddit, see [Youtube's HTML5 test](https://www.youtube.com/html5).

## Option B: Alternative Minimal setup

Alternatively one can use the packages `ffmpeg` and Cisco's h264 codecs
`mozilla-openh264, gstreamer1-plugin-openh264`, the later are in the
`fedora-cisco-openh264` repository which can be enabled via

- Fedora: `sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled fedora-cisco-openh264`
- Silverblue: edit the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-cisco-openh264.repo` and
  set `enabled`'s value to `1`

## Option C: Complete suite of codecs

To install the complete suite of multimedia codecs:

- Fedora: `sudo dnf groupupdate Multimedia`

This won't do anything if rpm-fusion's repositories are not enabled.

## VLC and GNOME Videos

While the previous method is perfectly fine for running VLC, it is more
advisable
to install VLC via Flatpak. This Flatpak comes bundled with all necessary codecs and
dependencies by default.

First add [Flathub](https://www.flathub.org/home) repository:

`flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`

Then install VLC via:

`flatpak install flathub org.videolan.VLC`

Alternatively, you can install GNOME Videos:

`flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Totem`

## Firefox flatpak

If you are using the [official Firefox Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.mozilla.firefox), which can be installed via

`flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox`

then you don't need any additional codecs. If you rather use ffmpeg codecs
instead of openh264, install the ffmpeg Flatpak extension version:

`flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.ffmpeg-full`

which matches the runtime of `org.mozilla.firefox`, which is usually the latest.
