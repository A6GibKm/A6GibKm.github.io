    In this paper, the well known relationship between theta functions and Heisenberg group actions thereon is resumed by merging complex algebraic and noncommutative geometry: in essence, we describe Hermitian-Einstein vector bundles on 2-tori via representations of noncommutative tori, thereby reconstructing Matsushima's setup and making the ensuing Fourier-Mukai-Nahm (FMN) aspects transparent. We prove the existence of noncommutative torus actions on the space of smooth sections of Hermitian-Einstein vector bundles on 2-tori preserving the eigenspaces of a natural Laplace operator. Motivated by the Coherent State Transform approach to theta functions, we extend the latter to vector valued thetas and develop an additional algebraic reinterpretation of Matsushima's theory making FMN-duality manifest again.

    In this work we study the differential aspects of the noncommutative geometry for the magnetic $$C^*$$-algebra which is a 2-cocycle deformation of the group $$C^*$$-algebra of R2. This algebra is intimately related to the study of the Quantum Hall Effect in the continuous, and our results aim to provide a new geometric interpretation of the related Kubo's formula. Taking inspiration from the ideas developed by Bellissard during the 80's, we build an appropriate Fredholm module for the magnetic $$C^*$$-algebra based on the magnetic Dirac operator which is the square root (à la Dirac) of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Our main result consist of establishing an important piece of Bellissard's theory, the so-called second Connes' formula. In order to do so, we establish the equality of three cyclic 2-cocycles defined on a dense subalgebra of the magnetic $$C^*$$-algebra. Two of these 2-cocycles are new in the literature and are defined by Connes' quantized differential calculus, with the use of the Dixmier trace and the magnetic Dirac operator.

    This work provides a first step towards the construction of a noncommutative geometry for the quantum Hall effect in the continuum. Taking inspiration from the ideas developed by Bellissard during the 80's we build a spectral triple for the $$C^*$$-algebra of continuous magnetic operators based on a Dirac operator with compact resolvent. The metric aspects of this spectral triple are studied, and an important piece of Bellissard's theory (the so-called first Connes' formula) is proved.

    In a recent paper by M. Măntoiu and M. Ruzhansky, a global
    pseudo-differential calculus has been developed for unimodular groups of type
    I. In the present article we generalize the main results to arbitrary locally
    compact groups of type I. Our methods involve the use of Plancherel’s theorem
    for non-unimodular groups. We also make connections with a $$C^*$$-algebraic
    formalism, involving dynamical systems, and give explicit constructions for
    the group of affine transformations of the real line.

    In recent papers and books, a global quantization has been developed for
    *unimodular* groups of type I. It involves operator-valued symbols defined
    on the product between the group $$G$$ and its unitary dual $$\widehat G$$,
    composed of equivalence classes of irreducible representations. For compact
    or for graded Lie groups, this has already been developed into a powerful
    pseudo-differential calculus. In the present article we extend the formalism
    to arbitrary locally compact groups of type I, making use of the Fourier
    theory of non-unimodular second countable groups. The unitary dual and its
    Plancherel measure being quite abstract in general, we put into evidence
    situations in which concrete forms are available. Kirillov theory and
    parametrizations of large parts of $$\widehat G$$ allow rewriting the basic
    formulae in a manageable form. Some examples of completely solvable groups
    are worked out.
